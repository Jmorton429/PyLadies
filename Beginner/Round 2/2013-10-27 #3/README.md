# PROJECT
Each group will create a short choose your own adventure game that will be expanded upon in future meetups. First, your group must come up with the idea for the game and draw out what you want each function to do. Then, each person in the group will write a function. After each person is finished, someone else in the group will review their code. After each person's code has been reviewed, the group will combine each function into one larger project. Test it to make sure it runs, then make a pull request to the [PyLadies Github](https://github.com/PyLadies-Boston/PyLadies-Boston-Meetups/tree/master/Beginner/Round%202/2013-10-27%20%233).
