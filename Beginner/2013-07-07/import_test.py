# PROJECT 2
# Fill in the body of the function definition for cat_n_times so that it will print the string, s, n times:
# 
# def cat_n_times(s, n):
# 	<fill in your code here>
# Save this function in a script named import_test.py. Now at a unix prompt, make sure you are in the same directory where the import_test.py is located ( ls should show import_test.py). Start a Python shell and try the following:
# 
# >>> from import_test import *
# >>> cat_n_times('Spam', 7)
# SpamSpamSpamSpamSpamSpamSpam
# If all is well, your session should work the same as this one. Experiment with other calls to cat_n_times until you feel comfortable with how it works.
