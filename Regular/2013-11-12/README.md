[November 12 Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Boston/events/122655592/)
================

Subjects covered:
* NLTK: [Anne Thessen](https://github.com/diatomsrcool) will be presenting her talk "Knowledge Extraction from the Encyclopedia of Life using Python NLTK". She will start by briefly describing the project, present the results and then get as far as she can with what she has been able to accomplish on the NLTK between now and then. She's presented the beginning of the talk previously at Boston Python, but the rest will be all new!

Even if you are a beginner, this talk will illustrate some of the cool things that you can do with Python!
