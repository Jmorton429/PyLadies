[December 18 Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Boston/events/122655702/)
================

Subjects covered:
* Science!: [Adrienne Bolger](https://github.com/abolger) will be presenting a tutorial on SciPy and MatPlotLib (with a bit of Numpy). Below is a description from Adrienne:

"The topic of this month's Meetup will be on using Python in the math and science research space, specifically, using the reknowned "MatPlotLib" and "SciPy" libraries!  We'll cover:

Importing data from data files (the biggest pain of them all in science!)
Plotting graphs, histograms, and 3d graphs
Some of the basic data processing topics as we have time: filtering data, peak detections, and identifying clusters of data!"

Even if you are a beginner, this talk will illustrate some of the cool things that you can do with Python!

INSTRUCTIONS:
In order to get down and dirty into all this as soon as possible, if you don't already have MatPlotLib and SciPy installed, please please please make it easy on yourself and just install the Canopy package (or at least download it before the meetup).  The Canopy package is a pre-packaged version of Python 2.7 and 120 common Python packages that the folks at Enthought developed because they were tired of installing Python packages.  It can be downloaded here for Mac, Linux, or Windows:

Once you download the file to your desktop, double click it to run the installer.
